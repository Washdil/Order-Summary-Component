### What I learned

I learnt alot regarding the colors and backgounds images and their shades and colors and to manipulate them and using the custom fonts from internet was quite cool , it was a beginner one so i hope to try something harder and challenging to improve my css and html skills to higer level.


### Continued development

After having a hands on experience on this small project i realized that i have some difficulties in responsiveness of the website and layouts of the websites which are consiered one of the most important skill for a devloper , in future i want to improve my skill in those particular topics
